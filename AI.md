# AI Usage Log

This file records my use of the AI tool ChatGPT 5 during the development of Jane, in accordance with the project guidelines.

This AI.md file was also partially created with the help of ChatGPT 5.

## Increments with AI Assistance

## 1. A-JavaDoc

How AI was used: I asked AI to generate Javadoc comments for multiple classes (Main, MainWindow, DialogBox, Jane, GuiUi, Parser, and all Command classes).

What worked well: AI provided consistent, professional-looking Javadoc that I could adapt with minimal edits.

Observations: It significantly reduced time spent on boilerplate documentation, letting me focus on correctness.

Time saved: Roughly 2–3 hours, since I didn’t have to write every Javadoc from scratch.

## 2. A-Personality, A-AiAssisted

How AI was used: I consulted AI to help brainstorm and polish Jane’s “goofy, over-the-top” personality for the GUI version (GuiUi class).

What worked well: AI generated a consistent “voice” (dramatic sound effects, exaggerated phrases) while staying within text-only constraints (no emojis).

Observations: It was especially helpful for quickly iterating on tone and style. Saved time compared to manually coming up with personality lines.

## Overall Reflections

Time efficiency: AI saved me time on documentation and polishing personality text, though I still had to review carefully for correctness and consistency.

Limitations: Occasionally verbose, needed trimming and tailoring to match my exact project requirements.

Value: Very helpful for routine tasks (like Javadoc) and creative tasks (like personality design).
